def pointdefect_wave(path=None, inputpath=None, **kwargs):
  """ Creates point-defect wave using ground-state job-dictionary. 

      :Parameters:
        path : str or None
          Path where the modified job-dictionary will be saved. Calculations will be
          performed in the parent directory of this file. If None, will use the
          current job-dictionary path.
        inputpath : str or None
          Path to an input file. If not present, then no input file is read and
          all parameters are taken from the non-magnetic wave.
        kwargs
          Any keyword/value pair to take precedence over anything in the input file.

      Creates a point-defect wave from the materials computed in the
      magnetic and non-magnetic waves. Usage is fairly simple. If the pickle
      for the magnetic/non-magnetic wave is called ``magnetic_wave``, then one
      need only open it and call the ``pointdefect_wave``.

      >>> explore all magnetic_wave 
      >>> import test
      >>> test.magnetic_wave()
      >>> launch scattered

      The above will add point-defect calculations for all meterials and
      lattices of the ``magnetic_wave`` job-dictionary and save it (to the same 
      path unless an argument is provided to ``magnetic_wave``). Note that
      changing the location of the current job-dictionary has no effect. It
      would be possible but sounds too error prone:

      >>> explore all magnetic_wave 
      >>> goto /Fe2AlO4 # has no effect on what point-defects are added.
      >>> goto /Al2FeO4 # has no effect on what point-defects are added.
      >>> import test
      >>> # creates point-defects for both Fe2AlO4 and Al2FeO4: location does not matter.
      >>> test.magnetic_wave() 
      >>> launch scattered

      Point-defects calculations are added to
      a material if and only if all existing magnetic/non-magnetic jobs for
      that material have completed successfully. Furthermore, only untagged
      materials are accepted. Hence, to disable Fe2AlO4 lattices from having
      point-defects added to it, one can simply tag it:

      >>> explore all magnetic_wave 
      >>> jobparams["/Fe2AlO4"] = 'off'
      >>> import test
      >>> test.magnetic_wave()
      >>> launch scattered

      Similarly to make sure point-defect calculations are *not* created for
      the b5 lattice of the Fe2AlO4 material, one could tag it as follows:

      >>> explore all magnetic_wave 
      >>> current_jobfolder["/Fe2AlO4/b5"].tag()
      >>> import test
      >>> test.magnetic_wave()
      >>> launch scattered
