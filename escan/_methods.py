def majority_representation(extractor, multicell, tolerance=1e-12): 
  """ Majority Represention for all unmapped kpoint. 

      :Parameters:
        extractor : `KExtract`
           Result of a `KEscan` calculation. The ``kpoints`` attribute from
           ``extractor.functional`` should be a class of *reduced* kpoints, such
           as `ReducedKGrid`, `ReducedKDensity`, or `ReducedBPoints`.
        multicell : numpy 3x3
           A matrix (M) linking the unit-cell (U) to the super cell (S), ``S = U
           * M``.  From this, the unit-cell is determined, whatever deformation
           may have happened, as engendered by VFF.
       
      :return: An  list of lists of 2-tuples. The first dimension corresponds
        to unreduced kpoints.  The 2-tuples consiste  of the eigenvalue for that
        kpoint and band, and of its majority representation. The inner list
        duplicate entries with respect to eigenvalues. It is meant to be used
        with matplotlib's hexbin.

      The majority representation is a way to get to the band-structure of an
      alloy despite the lack of translational symmetries. It was introduced by
      L.L.Wang *et al.* in  [LLW]_, and then further refined in [VP]_.
