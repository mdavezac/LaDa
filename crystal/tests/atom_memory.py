""" Check memory deallocation.

    Creates cyclic references through an atom's dictionary.
    A number of instances are created and gets difference in memory hogged by python.
    These instances are then deleted and gc.collect is called.
    We then go through a loop where the instantiation/creation steps are
    perfomed again, with gc.collect to make sure garbage is deleted. 
    Finally, we check that memory is 10 times less than after first creation above.

    Note that python does not release memory it allocates. Hence, deletion and
    gc.collect must be inside the loop, or test could give false negative.

    The same is checked for a subclass of atom.
